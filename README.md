# Shoe Inventory Management System

A Python-based inventory management system for tracking shoe stock. The program reads from and writes to a local `inventory.txt` file and allows users to manage shoe data through a simple menu-driven interface.

## What it does

- View all shoes in inventory as a formatted table
- Capture and add new shoe entries
- Restock the shoe with the lowest quantity
- Search for a shoe by its product code
- Calculate the total stock value per item
- Identify the shoe with the highest quantity (marked for sale)
